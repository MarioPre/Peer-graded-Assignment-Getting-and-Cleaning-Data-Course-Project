Solution for week4 - final class

The run_analysis.R script does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Shows the Activity Names
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the mean value of each variable for each activity and each subject; all data are stored in "tidyFile.txt"
